d’Post
Invite only DAO message board for d’Org culture
-

Personal Intro
My name is Louis Parker, who may or may not be known by the online alias MemeConscious. I have been developing fullstack + solidity code for about a year. I met many of the d’Org team at EthDenver 2020, where I won first prize at the hackathon with my talented partner (and fellow d’Org crew member) Jake Hamilton, building bonding curve markets for global impact events. Many thanks to the timely snowfall sparking the idea for snowfall futures markets.
Project Description
Many great ideas spring from the mindshare generated by networking talented people in a space. Hackathons are such a great nexus event, as the constraints of physicality possess natural curative propensities for generating spaces of like-minded individuals. ClubHouse is an example of a popular application which has recently risen to prominence through the creation of a highly curated space for Silicon Valley mindshare. It is increasingly necessary to create such highly curated spaces for productive mindshare which are entirely virtual. In order to accomplish the aforementioned task, social dapps must incorporate mechanisms which are conducive towards the curation of members which befit the social calibur of the desired milieu. In other words, virtual social spaces must intimately cater towards the habits and productive modes of their members.

For my activation proposal I have built d’Post, a working social space catered towards a culture interested in information concerning Ethereum, DeFi, and software development. d’Post is a message board which incorporates the following mechanisms:
Invite-only access 
Limit posts to 200 characters
Post curation through user signalling (like / dislike, et.c)
DAO governance for admin-level curation
Time-bound limitation on all user actions

The intended result of these mechanisms is to create a space for mindshare which will start with myself as the sole member and spread access to members of d’Org and people within the immediate network of d’Org members. With some success in user retention, d’Post can help to spread the culture of d’Org to a larger pool of talented individuals.
